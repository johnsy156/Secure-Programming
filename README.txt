DOWNLOAD THE TOOLS
MySQL Workbench:
1.	Go to https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ and download the below software:
 
2.	Once downloaded, install the software through the wizard that pops up by clicking Next.
3.	If the installer poses any requirement as not satisfied, please check and install those software as well before proceeding with further installation.
4.	Provide a valid password for the MySQL software (default username is root since it requires root privileges) and proceed.
5.	Click Execute and Next multiple times on the further screens in the installer. Click Finish. 
6.	Open the MySQL workbench application and login by clicking Database in the menu bar and giving the password by choosing “Store in Vault”.
7.	In the new window that opens, choose the “Create a New SQL tab” icon from the toolbar.
8.	Under the SQL tab, give the following commands:
-	create database <database-name>
-	use <database-name>
9.	Now, you will be able to create table and do the usual SQL operations to that database.
Note: For some reason, the installation was successful only after I installed Python 3.4. Also, ensure that the path variables are set properly for all the software. 

Python 3.4:
1.	This version of Python can be downloaded from: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
2.	Once downloaded, the installer will guide you to install the software in the desired location.

Notepad++:
1.	Download the desired version from: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.5.html
2.	Once downloaded, the installation gets done upon clicking the exe and the application is launched.
